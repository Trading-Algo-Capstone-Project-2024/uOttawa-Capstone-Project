AMZN,"The good, bad, and ugly of Big Tech's first quarter","The tech industry had a wild first quarter. From Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock price continuing to rocket higher and higher to Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) botched launch of its Gemini image generator and Apple’s antitrust battle, the first three months of the year were full of highs, lows, and, well, even lower lows.
The quarter was also full of surprises. Meta (META) announced its first dividend payment and a larger stock buyback program and Apple (AAPL), according to Bloomberg, decided to kill its long-gestating car program, putting an end to an effort that would have catapulted the company into the automotive industry.
Speaking of autos, EVs took it on the chin as sales fell off a cliff. And the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Union’s European Commission began sniffing around companies’ AI investments and more.
Oh, and did I mention Congress has revived efforts to ban TikTok in the US? Yes, it’s been a busy three months. And we still have nine more to go. These are the good, the bad, and the ugly stories of the first quarter of 2024.
The good
Let’s kick things off with the good news for the tech industry in the first quarter. First up is Nvidia, which continues to dominate the AI conversation. In February, the company announced another monster quarter, blowing past Wall Street’s expectations on revenue and earnings and beating out anticipated revenue for the current quarter.
Shares of Nvidia are up some 89% year to date and 226% over the last 12 months. And in March, the company debuted its new Blackwell AI processor architecture during its GTC conference, which felt more like a party than a developer event.
Also this quarter, Intel and the White House announced that the chipmaker is getting $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding to help build out its chip manufacturing and research and development facilities at plants across the US.

The cash from the CHIPS Act is meant to revitalize the US semiconductor industry, and with Intel starting to build chips for third-party companies like Microsoft, it should benefit handsomely from the funding.

AMZN,"Amazon Deals Another Blow to Already Beaten Down Office Market, Breaking Leases to Cut $1.3 Billion in Expenses","Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is reportedly looking to reduce its office vacancies and save $1.3 billion in the process by letting leases expire, negotiating early terminations, and ending the use of some floors in its current offices, according to Business Insider (BI), which cited a source familiar with that matter and internal documents obtained by BI.
The news comes as the commercial real estate market has already taken a beating over the last couple of years. It has faced significant challenges since the Covid-19 pandemic, which ignited the widespread adoption of remote work arrangements. With many companies transitioning to remote work models, the demand for office space has plummeted, leading to high vacancy rates in urban centers and traditional business districts.

The trend in commercial real estate led to Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying, ""There will be more bank failures,"" because ""Banks will have made loans to many of those buildings,"" which have many empty offices. ""We have identified the banks that have high commercial real estate concentration and we are in dialogue with them,"" he added.

AMZN,Amazon is cutting hundreds of jobs in its cloud computing unit AWS,"Amazon said Wednesday it's cutting hundreds of jobs in its cloud computing unit AWS as part of a strategic shift.
The company will trim “a few hundred roles” in the team that overlooks technology for physical stores, a move that comes just a day after Amazon said it was ditching Just Walk Out technology in its U.S. grocery stores.
In addition to the physical stores technology team, Amazon said it’s cutting “several hundred roles” in the AWS sales, marketing and global service organization. Most of those cuts are related to business changes in AWS training and certification programs as well as sales operations. The tech giant said it was also making cuts elsewhere so it can invest in other business priorities.
“These decisions are difficult but necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers,” Amazon spokesperson Duncan Neasham said in a statement.
The AWS layoffs follow other layoffs that happened at Amazon and its subsidiaries this year. In January, the company cut several hundred positions across its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit. That same month, Twitch, the popular social media platform owned by Amazon, laid off more than 500 jobs in a bid to save on costs. The online audiobook and podcast service Audible also laid off about 5% of its workforce.
Amazon says it will continue to hire in priority areas. The company currently has thousands of AWS job openings posted online. It says it will try to find internal opportunities for employees whose roles are impacted.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-cutting-hundreds-jobs-cloud-152552547.html,1 star,0.409060537815094
AMZN,The two best-positioned megacap tech stocks in 2024: Analyst,"Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) were among the tech stock leaders who drove growth in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) throughout 2024's first quarter. The two Magnificent Seven members are Wells Fargo Senior Analyst Ken Gawrelski's top stock picks for the tech sector.
Amazon is ""making many fundamental improvements in logistics capabilities and efficiencies. So, we expect margins to continue to inflect higher in the retail business,"" Gawrelski tells Yahoo Finance. ""The second business, which is AWS [Amazon Web Services], their cloud business, that was also an inflection in 2023, but that inflection was there after a steep decline of growth from 2022 to 2023.""

- Megacap tech names like Google, Meta, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon drop 43% of the S&P 500 gains in the first quarter of this year. This is according to Yahoo Finance calculations. So we're seeing a bit of a reversal here at the start of April. Can they keep up that momentum through the second quarter? Doesn't look like it so far.
We want to bring in Ken Gawrelski. He's a Wells Fargo senior analyst. Ken, let's just take a step back. What is your outlook here when it comes to big tech following that massive run up that we saw not only in the first quarter, but going back to what we saw in 2023?
KEN GAWRELSKI: Right. Thank you so much for having me. So we're certainly most positive on Amazon of the big three. But we also recommend Meta. And we see really strong fundamental trends here.
And I would say there are certainly pockets of the market where valuations look a bit stretched. But I would say that's not so much the case in these three. But we prefer the fundamentals certainly in Amazon, our top pick, and Meta relative to Google.
- Ken, I wonder in how you're looking across some of the themes that were really drivers for the largest names in tech, where those themes either remain strong or w you're starting to see some weakness.

AMZN,Costco offering members access to weight-loss programs including medication,"April 3 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale will offer its members access to weight-loss programs, including prescription drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, from online healthcare services provider Sesame, as the companies expanded their partnership.
The wholesale retailer's members can subscribe to Sesame's weight-loss program for $179 for three months, compared with $195 for non-members, Sesame said in a blog post on Tuesday.
Under the program, a clinician would help the patients with diet, exercise and lifestyle modifications, and may subscribe medications, subject to availability, the blog post said.
The subscription does not cover costs of medication or lab work. The clinicians will work with eligible patients for medication on a pre-authorization, which could reduce cost further, the company told Reuters in statement.
Demand for GLP-1 agonists, a class of highly effective diabetes and obesity drugs, has surged in the last few years, with thousands of prescriptions being filled out every week in the United States.
The membership-only retail chain did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for additional comment. Costco had 130 million members as of Feb. 18, as per the company's website.
Sesame first partnered with Costco last September to offer outpatient medical care to its members.
In March, Costco missed expectations for second-quarter revenue, hurt by lower gasoline prices impact and soft discretionary spend from consumers.
Big-box retailers such as Amazon and Walmart have been offering healthcare services following the pandemic.
Amazon offers virtual primary care service for Prime members through One Medical, which it bought in 2022.
Walmart runs primary care centers at its stores and its membership warehouse club retail chain, Sam's Club, sells GLP-1 drugs through its pharmacies.

NVDA,Nvidia supplier SK Hynix to invest $3.87 billion in US chip packaging plant,"SEOUL (Reuters) - SK Hynix, the world's second-largest memory chip maker, said on Wednesday it will invest around $3.87 billion to build an advanced packaging plant and research and development facility for AI products in the U.S. state of Indiana.
The new plant will include an advanced chip production line to mass-produce next-generation high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, currently used in graphic processing units that train artificial intelligence systems, the Nvidia supplier said in a statement.
Mass production is planned to start in the second half of 2028. The new facility in West Lafayette, Indiana will also house a packaging R&D line.
The facility ""will help strengthen supply chain resilience"" for AI chips in the U.S., CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said.
The engineering talent pool provided by the region's Purdue University, infrastructure for chip manufacturing, and support from the state and local government were factors in the chipmaker's decision, it said.
SK pledged in 2022 to invest $15 billion in the semiconductor industry through R&D programs, materials, and the creation of an advanced packaging and testing facility in the U.S.
Last month it began mass production of the latest version of HBM chips, called HBM3E, with sources saying initial shipments are going to Nvidia.
SK Hynix has been the sole supplier of the version previously used - the HBM3 - to Nvidia, which has 80% of the market for AI chips.

NVDA,$2.2 trillion Nvidia is colliding with Taiwans biggest earthquake in 25 years as its key chip supplier grapples with factory fallout,"The 7.4-magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan Wednesday morning could rock AI darling Nvidia after its main chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) temporarily halted production and evacuated its factories.
TSMC said it moved staff from some production centers after its science parks in Hsinchu, Longtan, Zhunan, and Taichung experienced earthquake shocks with a magnitude up to 5.0. Initial inspections of TSMC’s construction sites were normal, but it said a “small number” of tools were damaged in certain production areas that partially impacted operations. Fabrication plant tool recovery was at over 70% within 10 hours of the quake, and none of TSMC's critical tools were impacted, the company reported. The chip manufacturer’s local rival United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) also took measures to evacuate certain facilities and halt some operations.
“TSMC’s safety systems are operating normally,” the company said in a statement to Fortune. “Preventative measures to ensure employee safety and well-being were initiated at that time according to procedure, and some fabs were evacuated. All personnel are safe and returned to their workplace shortly after the incident.”
UMC did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment. An Nvidia spokesperson told Fortune the company is monitoring the situation and ensuring employee safety, but has not released an official statement.
Nvidia is TSMC’s second-largest client, behind only Apple, and relies on the manufacturer to produce the semiconductor chips it designs for chip systems that power AI software and advanced graphics processing units. Last year, Nvidia paid the chipmaker $7.73 billion for its services, accounting for 11% of TSMC’s revenue, according to financial analyst Dan Nystedt. With a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, Nvidia is the third-largest company in the U.S., effectively driving the AI revolution.
TSMC and UMC shares faltered about 1.3% and 1%, respectively, early Wednesday, while Nvidia shares have remained steady.
