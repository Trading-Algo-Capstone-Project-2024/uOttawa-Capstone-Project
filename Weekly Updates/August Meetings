August Meeting(s) notes
- Discussion about the general progress of the project
- Discussion about more in depth financial concepts for portofolio management
    - How market cap is a strong indicator of value
    - How to calculate risk (beta, correlation, expostion level, etc)
    - Sector based investing approach


What we are working on:
- Prototype for the whole project
  -  Rough prototype for the project to see how each part work together
  - Start focusing more on the backend stuff (ML model, news data rating)

- Working on portfolio management
  - Thresholds approach - buy and sell based on % from inital buy point
  - Capital spread in a lot of different companies to minimize risk - similar to an ETF

- ML Research
  - Currently research on how to implement an LSTM model to our project
  - Need to figure out how to run the model on the GPU instead of the CPU
