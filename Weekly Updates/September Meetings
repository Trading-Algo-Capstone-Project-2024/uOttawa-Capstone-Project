What we are working on:
- Prototype for the whole project

  -  Start focusing more on the backend stuff (ML model, news data rating)

- Working on portfolio management
  - Thresholds approach - buy and sell based on % from inital buy point
  - Capital spread in a lot of different companies to minimize risk - similar to an ETF
  - Mostly focused in the S&P 500 and a portion of NASDAQ

- ML Research
  - Currently research on how to implement an LSTM model to our project
  - Need to figure out how to run the model on the GPU instead of the CPU

What we plan to work on:
- improving data readbility
- improving ML model
