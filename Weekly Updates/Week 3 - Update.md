        - Creating trading strategies
        - Market sentiment analysis using LLM
        - Backtesting strategies
        - Testing the code (QA)
        - Ensuring 100% coverage of test cases

Objectives
    Benefit to customer
        - Customerâ€™s trading strategy setup
        - Market sentiment scanner
    Key objective
        - Making a profitable trading strategy
    Criteria for success
        - Having a successful trading strategy backtested over a period of one month
            - Criteria for a successful strategy
                - ((winning %  profit per win)(losing%  loss per loss)  0)

Expected architecture
    - Python logic base
    - Python API calls 
        - Using Interactive Brokers
    - Graphing TBD
        - Would probably be coded in R


Anticipated risks (engineering challenges)
    Market Movement Coverage
    - Make sure our codealgo still works in the case of trading halts
    Sentiment tracker accuracy
    - Holding sentiment over a time period
    Volatility comprehension
    - No bugs or crash during high volatility and volume
    - Getting accurate level 2 data during high volume periods
    Negative trading strategy
    - Strategy only works for a short timeframe
    - Profit ratioaccuracy rate of the strategy is too low
    Factor weight
    - Making sure each factor in the algorithm (market sentiment, indicators,market conditions, etc) is correctlyoptimally weighted


Legal and social issues
    - Tax return complexity (if real money is used)
        - Trading in other markets
