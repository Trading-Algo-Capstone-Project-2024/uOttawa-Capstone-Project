Second meeting with client (Feb 27th):
- Meeting went great, we are still on the same page.
- We discussed our roadblocks and are working together to resolve them.
- Talked about the scope of the project and how we need to make sure of what software we need to use in order to stay efficient and on time.


What we are working on:
- Web scrapper: 
  - Was able to scrappe more information from yahoo finance such as the price, headlines and the content of the articles
  - Wtih a different approach we were able to display the results of the web scrapping on a local web page
- IBRK API
  - Learning more about how to use the API
- Large language models
  - Researching how to use LLM in our project to determine if market sentiment is positive or negative based on the content of the articles

Issues/Roadblocks
- Subscription Paywall for the 3 target web sites for web scrapping:
  - Our client (Telfer Prof) is currently waiting for funding from Telfer and will provide the subscriptions if there is no other way to web scrappe the data
  - We will receive the news in around 2 weeks, in the meantime we will scrappe data from other sources as a workaround


what we plan to do:
- Improve the look and feel of the local web page since it is currently only basic HTML/CSS
- Find a way to use a LLM to analyse the web scrapped content to determine the direction of market sentiment
- Scrappe more useful information such as financial data, open/close prices, etc
- Implement a search function on the local web page to dynamically search for stock tickers instead of using a static ticker in the code

Ideas for future implementations (Not 100% certainty that we will add those to the project)
- Implement stocks charts on the local web page
