Fourth meeting with client (Mar 26th):
- Went into more details on how to approach the Macro concept discussed in the previous meeting:
  -  The concepts mentionned were : Individual stock, Sector of that stock, Overall Macro 
- From that discussion we learned about Fama/French data which is the gold standard for information about sectors
    - Informative topics discussed:
      - HML - book value vs entreprise value
      - Growth/Book ratio - low book to market is a good indicator
      - Yield curve - treasuries vs long term bonds
      - Fama/French data on Portfolios formed on size
      - Time length where data is still useful:
        - Industry structure - 1 year
        - Financial data - 6 months 
        - News - 1 month

What we are working on:
- Web scrapper: 
  - Working on implementing charts using Lightweight_Charts from TradingView
  - Working on improving the accuracy of financial data even more
- IBRK API
  - Currently on hold until we need real-time data
- Strategies
  - Creating and testing strategies
  - Backtesting strategies using TradingView
    - We need to convert the strategies from python to pine script to test them on TradinvgView
- Large language models
  - Trying different ways to implement LLM to analyse news 

Issues/Roadblocks
- Subscription Paywall for the 3 target web sites for web scrapping - Still a roadblock but of less importance since we agreed with our client that we don't need to use these source immediately
- Finding a good way to analyse market news while minimzing the cost  

What we plan to do:
- Keep improving the look and feel of the local web page 
- WIP - Find a way to use a LLM to analyse the web scrapped content to determine the direction of market sentiment
- Research more about how to implement macro elements in our strategies and which ones are useful to us
