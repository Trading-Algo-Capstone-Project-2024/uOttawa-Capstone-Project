Steve Eisman is one of the investors who predicted the financial collapse of 2008 and profited via a strategy known as ""the Big Short,"" where he bet against subprime mortgages. That's why so many follow his market moves, and it just so happens he's a big fan of tech stocks like Nvidia. Why? Calculating what your shares would be worth today if you invested $2,500 in Nvidia 10 years ago would explain everything.
The CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY.
Today, Eisman is a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. In a recent appearance on Bloomberg Television, Eisman expanded on his belief that the tech sector is set for sustained growth due to continued consumer demand for innovations like phone apps and AI enhancements in computing. He told Bloomberg that this demand is spurring ""the biggest refresh cycle in history.""
He believes this cycle means ""You have to own the big, large-cap, tech stocks"" such as Microsoft, Oracle, and Nvidia. Eisman also volunteered that he owns ""a lot"" of Nvidia. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) is one of the world's leading providers of graphics processing units (GPUs), important components in gaming computers that enhance the player experience. GPUs have recently become essential in AI development because they can be used as semiconductors.
In addition to this crossover usage in semiconductors, Nvidia is expanding the use of their GPUs into data center applications. This is due to Nvidia GPUs' ability to handle heavy workloads and complex tasks. As computer gaming, data centers, cloud storage, and other digital information solutions increase in complexity, their dependence on GPUs will only grow.
All these potential applications for Nvidia GPUs have created a perfect environment for Nvidia's stock to surge. Since the third quarter of 2023, Nvidia's stock has recently closed at $129.24. Nvidia's current market cap is estimated at a massive $3.2 trillion, and heavy hitters like Eisman think there is still room for more growth.
Can you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors.
Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Nvidia's bull run is that it was trading for around $0.47 per share in July 2014. Here is what your shares would be worth if you'd bought $2,500 worth of Nvidia shares in July 2014. A $2,500 investment would have bought you 5,319 shares of Nvidia stock. If you'd held on to your shares, they would be worth $687,446.80 today.

Key Takeaways
As many chip stocks fall on worries about tougher trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions, analysts suggested fears may be overblown, offering investors an opportunity to ""buy the dip.""
Wedbush and Jefferies analysts dismissed recent political rhetoric as ""noise"" in the chip companies' artificial intelligence (AI) story with limited impact.
Bank of America analysts said the recent volatility could present an ""enhanced opportunity"" to buy shares of companies like AI darling Nvidia.
UBS analysts noted the semiconductor sector can be prone to volatility, especially in an election year, and recommended that investors focus on the long-term value of AI exposure.


As many chip stocks fall on worries about tougher trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions, analysts indicated fears may be overblown, offering an opportunity for investors to ""buy the dip,"" citing potential growth from surging artificial intelligence (AI) demand.
Shares of chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), TSMC (TSM), and others were lower, while AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) wavered between gains and losses in intraday trading Thursday after Wednesday's sell-off.
'Noise' in the AI Bull Thesis
Concerns that geopolitical tensions could bring tech stocks' AI-fueled growth to a halt are unlikely to ""move the needle,"" according to Wedbush analysts.
""The political rhetoric during this political climate and Beltway races will be loud but ultimately just like our view since 2016 the bark will be way worse than the bite on the US/China Cold Tech War fears,"" the analysts wrote.
Jefferies analysts also dismissed geopolitical worries as more ""noise"" than substance, with limited impact, adding they viewed ""crowded positions and investors' worry about AI's ROI"" as more likely sources of concern.
An Opportunity To 'Buy the Dip?'
Bank of America analysts said they ""see current volatility as enhanced opportunity in companies with best-profitability,"" pointing to Nvidia among others.
Wedbush analysts also remained steadfast in their bullish view of the AI play, saying they see tech stocks going higher in the second half of 2024 into 2025, adding that they believe upcoming second-quarter earnings will be ""a major positive catalyst for the tech sector.""
UBS analysts noted that the semiconductor sector can be prone to volatility, especially during an election year in the U.S., and said they ""recommend focusing on building long-term exposure to AI, which we expect to be a key driver of equity returns in the coming years.""
